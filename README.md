# FlushReload-AutoSpying-Containers

This repository contains the source code of my class project: *I Know What You are Browsing:
A Side Channel Attack based on Flush and Reload*. This project proposes an automatic spying tool. Using this tool, the attack can know which web page the victim is visiting. Besides, this project also implements the attack in containers and discuss how to implement the attack in virtual environments.

This project is developed based on the code provided by [Side-Channel Attacks on Everyday Applications](https://github.com/defuse/flush-reload-attacks).
